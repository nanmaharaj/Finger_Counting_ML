# Finger_Counting_ML

Project : Classification II | Foundations of Modern Machine Learning Project

This mini-project tries to solve the computer-vision task of identifying the number of fingers held up in front of a camera using fundamental and basic ML Algorithms. The intent is to explain and teach the pros and cons of learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests & Support Vector Machines. This repo is a part of the course offered by iHub, IIIT Hyderabad : Foundations of Modern Machine Learning.

Observations: Random Forests outperformed the other algorithms, achieving the highest accuracy of 98.29%. This performance can be attributed to the ensemble approach, which reduces overfitting and increases generalization by averaging multiple Decision Trees. While SVMs also provided good accuracy, they require more computational resources and careful parameter tuning. Decision Trees, though the simplest and most interpretable, had the lowest accuracy due to their tendency to overfit.
